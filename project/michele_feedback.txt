I like the idea for your application a lot! Having a maze that the person has to solve when the alarm goes off is fantastic. The interface you made is also very easy to use (I can figure out where to set the alarm, I can figure out where to turn it off). Two things I especially like that you did is give the user feedback about what they did: (1) you told me what time the app thinks it is (and it changes every second), and (2) you told me what time the alarm should ring. This is great for a user, since I can then learn how to use the alarm inputs to set the alarm for the time I want. Often, people forget the importance of giving the user feedback about what they have done, so I am really glad to see that you did this, and did it well. 

This feedback actually came in handy for me because it is a bit unusual to figure out how to set the alarm - what the user is used to is just typing a time and having the alarm ring at that time. But what happened with your alarm is that the method of setting the alarm is different than what a user is used to. I donâ€™t know if you meant it this way, but the numbers you have to enter to set the alarm is the time after the current time that the alarm is set. This is alright for your app, but only because you set the user feedback in your design. 

Your alarm does work, but I never understand how I am supposed to do the puzzle - it seems like I can never actually do anything to it, even when the alarm is ringing. If there is a way to do this, the interface was not clear enough to give me a hint about what I am supposed to do. 

Good job on your project - you should be proud of figuring out how to make such a complicated app by teaching yourself something. I am excited to see what you come up with next.
